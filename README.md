### Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS)
This is a SwiftUI-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that challenges the player to either win or lose based on a randomly generated move by the app. The game keeps track of the player's score and provides feedback on whether the player's choice was correct according to the game's rules.

**Features**
- The app generates a random choice for itself (rock, paper, or scissors) and determines if the player should aim to win or lose the round.
- Players can make their move by choosing one of the three options: Rock (🪨), Paper (📄), or Scissors (✂️).
- Provides feedback on whether the player's move was correct.
- Displays the player's current score.
